# Example-2

Example number 2 from Chapter 5 of [Bootstrapping Microservices](http://bit.ly/2o0aDsP).

In Chapter 5 of Bootstrapping Microservices you learn how to make microservices talk to each other with HTTP requests and RabbitMQ messages.

You need Docker and Docker-Compose installed to run this.

Boot it up from the terminal using:

    docker-compose up --build
